The strncpy(s1,s2,n) function copies exactly n characters from s2 to s1, truncating
s2 or padding it with extra null characters as necessary. The target string may not be
null-terminated if the length of s2 is n or more. The function returns s1. Write your own
version of this function; call it mystrncpy(). Test the function in a complete program
that uses a loop to provide input values for feeding to the function.
