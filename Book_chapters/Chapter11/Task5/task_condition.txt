Design and test a function that searches the string specified by the first function
parameter for the first occurrence of a character specified by the second function
parameter. Have the function return a pointer to the character if successful, and a null
if the character is not found in the string. (This duplicates the way that the library
strchr() function works.) Test the function in a complete program that uses a loop to
provide input values for feeding to the function.
