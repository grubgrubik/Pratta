Write a function that sets each element in an array to the sum of the corresponding
elements in two other arrays. That is, if array 1 has the values 2, 4, 5, and 8 and array 2
has the values 1, 0, 4, and 6, the function assigns array 3 the values 3, 4, 9, and 14. The
function should take three array names and an array size as arguments. Test the function
in a simple program
