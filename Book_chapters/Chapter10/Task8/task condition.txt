Use a copy function from Programming Exercise 2 to copy the third through fifth
elements of a seven-element array into a three-element array. The function itself need
not be altered; just choose the right actual arguments. (The actual arguments need not be
an array name and array size. They only have to be the address of an array element and a
number of elements to be processed.)
